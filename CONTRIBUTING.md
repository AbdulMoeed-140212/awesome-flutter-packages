# Contribution Guidelines

This List collects the **most valuable** packages. Please only suggest your favourite packages which could be useful to many developers.

*Thank you for your suggestions :)*

## How to add a package

1. Choose a category (look into the `packages` folder)
2. Create a file with the name: `your_pub_package_name.md`
3. The first line is the title of your package `Your Package`
4. Add a short description and an image(s) **OR** a short code sample

*Please keep the height of your entry as small as possible.*

## Images

If you want to add images to your package, save them in the `images` folder.
Name your images after the following convention: `your_package_name1.png`, `your_package_name2.png` etc.

### Image Size

It is very important to keep your image file sizes **VERY** small.  
Never submit a image larger than 1MB. PNGs and JPGs should be much smaller.

*Hint:* Use tinypng.com for PNGs and ezgif.com/optimize for GIFs and JPGs.

### Link images in your entry

Add the following HTML to your entry to add the image (adjust dimensions): 
```html
<img src="images/your_package_name1.png" width="250px">
```

## Sample

```markdown
auto_size_text

```
