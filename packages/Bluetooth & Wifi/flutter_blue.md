FlutterBlue

Popular Bluetooth plugin for Flutter

FlutterBlue aims to offer the most from both platforms (iOS and Android).

Using the `FlutterBlue` instance, you can scan for and connect to nearby devices. Once connected to a device, the `BluetoothDevice` object can discover services, characteristics, and descriptors. The `BluetoothDevice` object is then used to directly interact with characteristics and descriptors.
