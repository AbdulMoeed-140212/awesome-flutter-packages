SpriteWidget is a toolkit for building complex, high performance animations and 2D games with Flutter. Your sprite render tree lives inside a widget that mixes seamlessly with other Flutter and Material widgets. You can use SpriteWidget to create anything from an animated icon to a full fledged game.
